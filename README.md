# DNA Sequence Analyzer Tool

## 🚀 Project Overview

This Python-based **DNA Sequence Analyzer Tool** is designed to process DNA sequences efficiently. It enables users to:

- 📂 **Load sequences from a file** instead of manual input.
- 🔬 **Analyze nucleotide frequencies** to understand sequence composition.
- 🧬 **Identify motifs** (specific patterns) within sequences.
- 📊 **Compare sequences** for similarity analysis.

This project showcases **Python fundamentals, file handling, string manipulation, and algorithmic processing**, making it a great demonstration of bioinformatics and data science techniques.

## 🔧 Features & Functionalities

✔ **File-Based Input** – Users can upload a `.txt` file containing multiple DNA sequences.  
✔ **Nucleotide Frequency Analysis** – Calculates occurrences of A, T, C, and G.  
✔ **Motif Identification** – Searches for specific DNA patterns within sequences.  
✔ **Sequence Comparison** – Measures similarity between sequences.  
✔ **Modular Code Structure** – Functions are organized for readability and scalability.

## 🛠 Installation & Usage

### **🔹 Prerequisites**

Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed. You can check your version using:

```sh
python --version
```

### **🔹 Clone the Repository**  
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mdarukha/DNA-Analyzer-Tool.git
cd DNA-Analyzer-Tool
```

### **🔹 Run the Program**
After cloning the repository, navigate to the project folder and run the program:

```sh
python DNA-Analyzer-Tool.py
```

### **🔹 Input Format**
Prepare a .txt file with one sequence per line. Here's an example of the format:

```objectivec
ATGCTAGCTAGCTAGC
CGTATCGATCGATCGA
GCTAGCTAGCTAGCTA
```
When prompted by the program, input the filename of your .txt file and the motif you want to search for.

## 📊 Example Output
```sh
Enter filename: sequences.txt
Enter motif to search: ATG

🔬 Nucleotide Frequencies:
A: 10, T: 7, G: 6, C: 5

🧬 Motif 'ATG' found at positions: [0, 14]

✅ Sequences successfully analyzed!
